# Fetch 1.1 changelog

![screenfetch mode](http://i.imgur.com/nW3HiNP.png)<br \>
<sup>New screenfetch mode</sup>

- If `w3m` or `imagemagick` aren't installed we gracefully fallback to ascii mode.
- Automatically find the `w3m-img` path and fallback to ascii mode if not found. \[1\]
- Fix padding escape codes on BSD systems.
- Swap escape codes from `\e` to `\033` for consistency.
- We only move the cursor to the bottom of the terminal in w3m/iterm2 rendering modes.
- Cursor position is now dynamic in ascii mode based on the height of the ascii and info text.
- If images and ascii are off, don't clear the terminal
- The script now exits correctly instead of always exiting with status code `1`
- If the script exits for any reason, unhide the cursor.
- Removed duplicate blocks inside `getcpu` and `getmemory`.
- Removed `--colors` as it was apparently broken from day 1.
- Usage has been reformatted so that every flag has a value.

\[1\] Setting `$w3m_img_path` will make the script look there first.

### Image

- Added support for displaying ascii art inside of text files.
- Added "screenfetch mode" which will display your distro's ascii art next to the info. \[1\]<br \>
- Added `--ascii_distro` to choose which distro's ascii logo to display.
- Added `--ascii_colors` and `$ascii_colors` which allow you to change the colors of the ascii art<br \>
and distro logos. \[2\]
- Added `--size` and `$image_size` to set the image size in pixels.
- Rename `--shuffledir` and `$shuffledir` to `shuffle_dir`.
- Rename `--imgtempdir` and `$imgtempdir` to `thumbnail_dir`
- Removed `--split_size` and `$split_size` as they were weird and confusing to use.
- Default thumbnail directory is now `$HOME/.cache/thumbnails/fetch`. Thanks @tudurom
- If `--image` and `--ascii` are left empty we fallback to ascii distro mode.

Example usage of ascii from file:

```sh
fetch --ascii "path/to/ascii" --ascii_color 2

```

\[1\] **[How do I enable screenfetch mode?](http://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch#how-do-i-enable-screenfetch-mode)**<br \>
\[2\] `ascii_colors` takes a range of colors which allows you to color every aspect of<br \>
distro and OS ascii art. For custom art the script will color the entirety of it using<br \>
the first value of `ascii_colors`. If `ascii_colors` is left empty, color will be disabled.


### Config file

- Fetch now has a config file that you can share with people and keep between<br \>
script versions!
- Added `--config` and `$config_file` to specify a custom config location.
- Added `--config off`, `--config none` and `$config` to enable / disable config files<br \>
at launch or in script.


### Makefile

- Fetch now has a make file due to the increasing number of files,<br \>
this allows the script to be easily installed and uninstalled on<br \>
systems it isn't packaged for yet! \[1\]

\[1\] The script will still work just fine on its own, you'll just be missing<br \>
the distro ascii art and the automatic config creation.


### Packages

- Fetch now has a Gentoo/Funtoo e-build courtesy of @z1lt0id


### Stdout

- Added `stdout` mode which allows you to fetch info in a plain text format that works<br \>
with lemonbar and in your scripts. You can use it by launching fetch with `--stdout` to print all functions enabled<br \>
in your `printinfo` function. You can selectively print functions by passing arguments to `--stdout`<br \>
like so:

```sh
# Print the output of all info functions enabled in printinfo
fetch --stdout

# Print the output of memory
fetch --stdout memory

# Print the output of memory and disk
fetch --stdout disk

# Print the output of all functions excluding x
fetch --stdout --disable kernel packages gtktheme

```

- Added `--stdout_seperator` and `$stdout_seperator` which takes a string and adds it<br \>
as a seperator between the output.
- Added `--stdout_title` and `$stdout_title` which allow you to toggle the `title@hostname`<br \>
from appearing in the output.
- Added `--stdout_subtitles` which allow you to toggle the `Info:` titles from appearing in<br \>
the output.

```sh
# Hiding subtitles
fetch --stdout --stdout_subtitles off

# Custom seperator
fetch --stdout disk gpu --stdout_seperator "  |  "

```

**NOTE:** `stdout_subtitles` and `stdout_title` only work when `--stdout` is used on its own.

### Info

- You can now display info without a subtitle. eg. `info memory`
- Added `--disable` which allows you to stop an info line from appearing at launch.<br \>
- Added `--underline` and `$underline` which allow you to toggle visibility of the<br \>
underline at launch and in your config.

```sh
# Stop cpu, gpu, disk and shell functions from being called
fetch --disable cpu gpu disk shell
```

**Kernel:** Added `--kernel_shorthand` and `$kernel_shorthand` to print less or more kernel info<br \>
**Window Manager:** Added support for `$XINITRC`<br \>
**GTK:** Fix incorrect GTK3 theme being displayed<br \>
**CPU:** `cpu_shorthand`: New substitutions<br \>
**GPU:** `[Linux]` Count the number of identical GPUs. eg. `Nvidia Geforce GTX 970 x 2`<br \>
**Memory:** `[Mac OS X]` Added wired memory to memory usage.<br \>

**Distro:**

- Added support for showing OS architecture. eg `Arch Linux x86_64`, `Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit` \[1\]
- Mac OS X: Added support for showing Max OS X build version. \[2\]
- Windows: Distro now displays Windows edition. eg. `Windows 7 Ultimate`

\[1\] You can toggle this using `--os_arch` and `$os_arch`.<br \>
\[2\] You can toggle it using `--osx_buildversion` and `$osx_buildversion`.

**Shell:**

- Added `--shell_version` and `$shell_version` to hide/show your shell's version.
- Added `--shell_path` and `$shell_path` to hide/show the path to your shell

**Birthday:**

- Added `birthday` which prints the age of your OS install.
- Added `--birthday_shorthand` and `$birthday_shorthand` to shorten/lengthen<br \>
the output of birthday.
- Added `--birthday_time` and `$birthday_time` to show/hide the time in the output.

**Battery:**

- Added `battery` which prints the battery usage percentage for each battery<br \>
in your system.
- Linux: Added `battery_num` which allows you to choose which battery to display, <br \>
it also takes the value `all` which will print all batteries line by line.
- Linux: Added `battery_shorthand` which when set to `on` prints each battery on the<br \>
same line like so:

```sh
# battery_shorthand="on"
Battery: 10%, 5%, 67%

# battery_shorthand="off"
Battery0: 10%
Battery1: 5%
Battery2: 67%

# If there's only a single battery in the system
# we ommit the numbered title.
Battery: 10%
```

- **NOTE:** This currently doesn't support BSD systems as we have no one to help us test
    - See **[Issue #46](https://github.com/dylanaraps/fetch/issues/46)**
