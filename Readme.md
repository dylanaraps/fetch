# fetch.sh

## Big update: Check the releases page.

This is the home of my fetch script! This script gathers info <br\>
about your system and prints it to the terminal.

If you're having any issues or have any ideas, please open an issue! <br\>
I can't test on many other distros and I want this to work <br\>
for as many people as possible.

## Dependencies

These are the script's required dependencies

-  Text formatting, dynamic image size and padding: tput

These are the script's optional dependencies:

-  Displaying Images: w3m
-  Image Cropping: ImageMagick
-  Display Wallpaper: feh
-  Current Song: mpc

## Usage

The script now supports dynamic image sizing and padding,
<br\> it's enabled by default and there's a variable you
<br\> need to set for it to work correctly.

You can either change the variable $fontwidth inside of the
<br\> script or launch it with ```--font_width num```.

Once you set the var the script will scale the image and padding
<br\> to fit your terminal window.

Please report any bugs or issues you're having with this as I can't
<br\> test with many configurations.

## TODO

Here's what's on my todo list

- Uptime doesn't work in OS X yet.

- If the customizable info includes a third colon then it breaks.

- Windows support (I'm almost done)

- Option to swap the image and text around

- Imagemagick optimizations

- Cleanup of info array handling

- More info outputs. Now that it's easy to customize what's printed and
  everything is a function we can add optional support for pretty much anything.

    - Resolution
    - GTK themes
    - Terminal Font
    - GPU
    - IP
    - etc
